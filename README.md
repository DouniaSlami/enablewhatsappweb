Enable WhatsApp Web extension
=============================

A Firefox addon to disable the checks WhatsApp put in place to disallow Firefox users from using WhatsApp Web.
Heavily based on "enablegoogleinbox", a similar addon for Google's Inbox service. Thanks @h4writer for writing it!

Technical details:
- WhatsApp uses User Agent testing to show a "not supported" message to the Firefox browser. This addon spoofs to be Google Chrome for the WhatsApp Web page, fixing this issue.

Issues:
- I tested this in Firefox 35 only. If you find any issues, please report them and I'll see what I can do.
